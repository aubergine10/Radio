[item-description]

blue-wire=Used to link multiplexed devices (mast, multiplexer, demultiplexer, bridge). Can only be attached to blue connectors.

radio-wire-pack=A small pack of patch cables, mostly used for radio equipment.

radio-mast-guide=These strong cables are used to hold tall structures in place.

radio-mast-antenna=A reel of antenna wire, used in radio masts.

radio-mast-segment=A pack of scaffolding and other materials used in the construction of radio masts.

radio-main-mast=A large mast, capable of transmitting and receiving radio signals. Once placed, upgrades can be used to add new features.

radio-small-mast=A smaller mast that is only capable of receiving radio signals. Once placed, upgrades can be added to receive additional channels.

radio-modulator=When added to masts, adds new FM (green) analog frequencies that are more reliable than the originl AM (red) frequencies.

radio-digital=When added to masts, adds a new digital (blue) service for reliable transmission of multiplexed signals.

radio-mux=Multiplexes 4 named inputs (2 red, 2 green) to 1 mulitplexed output (blue).

radio-demux=Splits 1 multiplexed input (blue) to 4 normal outputs (2 red, 2 green).

radio-wifi-wan=When added to masts, provides a new multiplexed (blue) cellular WiFi channel which automatically links your digital service to any WiFi-enabled devices (bridges and cards) within range.

radio-wifi-hub=Provides 4 named inputs (2 red, 2 green), 4 normal outputs (2 red, 2 green), 1 multiplex input (blue), 1 multiplex output (blue), and a cellular WiFi link (must be within range of WiFi-enabled mast).

radio-wifi-card=When added to a structure, it links to the cellular WiFi (blue) network (must be within range of a WiFi-enabled mast).

radio-encrypt=When added to a transmitter mast, encrypts all sigals sent via the digital (green) service.

radio-geodesic=Used to build geodesic domes, such as the snooper building.

radio-snooping=Provides classification of enemy radio, radar and snooper structures. Research adds more features, such as structure locating and signal espionage.

radio-passive=When added to a structure, this module automatically tunes operation to minimise radio frequency interference (RFI). This reduces packet loss for nearby masts and, if added to a mast, snooper or radar, hinders enemy snooping, triangulation and espionage activity.

radio-decrypt=When added to a mast allows the structure to process encrypted digital (blue) radio signals. When added to a snooper, increases the chance of decyphering encrypted enemy signals.

[technology-description]

radio-network=The radio network allows wireless transmission of circuit signals between your outposts via AM (red) analog frequencies.

radio-modulate=Allows you to upgrade masts to add new FM (green) analog frequencies which are more reliable (less packet loss) than the original AM (red) analog frequencies.

radio-digital=Allows you to upgrade masts to add a new digital (blue) service that provides error-free transmission of unlimited named (multiplexed) signals.

radio-wifi=Allows you to upgrade masts to add a new cellular WiFi (blue) service that connects all nearby WiFi-enabled devices (bridges, cards) to each other and your digital (blue) service.

radio-advanced=Adds more module slots. Extends range of AM (red) and FM (green) frequencies. Allows custom routing between digital (blue), cellular WiFi (blue) and analog (red and green) services.

radio-encrypt=Encrypt digital (blue) transmissions for added secuirity against enemy espionage.

radio-snooping=Allows you to build snoopers (must be within range of one of your masts) which classify enemy mast, radar and snooper structures.

radio-triangulate=Allows snoopers to determine exact location of enemy masts, radar and snoopers, revealing them on the map.

radio-espionage=Allows snoopers to intercept enemy transmissions and expose their contents.

radio-passive=Enables a module that reduces RFI (Radio Frequency Interference). When added to a structure, reduces packet-loss of nearby masts and hinders enemy snooping, triangulation and espionage.

radio-decrypt=Enables a module that decrypts encrypted digital (blue) signals. Can be added to masts to decrypt your signals, and snoopers to attempt decryption of enemy signals.
